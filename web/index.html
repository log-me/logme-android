					<p>The book we put in is a bag that documents you what you have forgotten by reading the square code or barcode we placed on objects such as a document laptop or comparing it with your tomorrow's lesson or work schedule. In addition, thanks to the solar systems on it, it generates electricity from solar energy and it will use it to charge my phone or laptop wirelessly inside the bag. In addition, there will be a heating system on the back of the bag and your back will be warm in winter. Thanks to this bag we have designed by combining all these features; We do not forget the materials we need to bring with us for tomorrow, we can charge our phone or laptop without having to search for a socket or powerbank in the outside, and we are less affected by cold in the winter months.

                                <p>Resistance heating wire uses electrical resistance to generate heat from electric current. Resistance heating wire consists of materials that have a high degree of electrical resistance, which is a property of a material that resists the flow of electricity. As the electricity flows through the resistant material, electrical energy is converted into heat energy.The diameter and length of the wire have an impact on its electrical resistance. In general, thinner wires are more resistant than thicker ones, and the longer a wire becomes, the more resistant it is. For this reason, resistance heating wire is often coiled from one very long and thin wire.</p>

                                <p>Essentially wireless charging uses electromagnetic fields to safely transfer power from a transmitting source to a receiving device for the purposes of charging (or recharging) a battery.  And as the name suggests, it does so without the use of a physical connection.
 Wireless Charging provides a convenient, safe, and reliable way to charge and power millions of electrical devices at home, in the workplace and in industry.
By eliminating the use of physical connectors and cables, wireless charging provides a number of efficiency, cost and safety advantages over the traditional charging cable.
From smartphones, to hand-held industrial devices and heavy-duty equipment applications, wireless power maintains safe, continuous, and reliable transfer of power to ensure all varieties of devices and equipment are charged and ready to go at a moment’s notice.
Wireless charging is based on the principle of magnetic resonance, or Inductive Power Transfer (IPT).  This is the process of transferring an electrical current between two objects through the use of coils to induce an electromagnetic field.

                <h2>Solved Problems</h2>
                <p> Due to having different programs according to the needs of daily or business life, the problem of identifying the materials that people should keep with them and the problem of forgetting the materials to be placed in the bag. As a solution to these problems, it is necessary to inform the software system of the bag according to the work schedule and to remind the users when the time of these materials is available.
In addition, as a solution to the energy problem, there is a solar panel on the outer surface of the bag and the energy of this solar panel's wireless charger, heater and square code reader system.
A wireless charging mechanism that takes energy from a solar panel as a solution to the problem of charging in places where electronic devices do not have an electrical source.

	<h2>Solar Panel</h2>
	<p>Solar energy is an energy that is widely used today, clean, easy to store and everywhere you can reach to the sunlight. More and more jobs require people to be outside for the jobs with devices that require power. Battery packs are a must in these situations, but including a way to charge keep these devices and battery packs charged gives you one less thing you have to worry about. Thanks to the panels on the bag, solar energy is stored in the battery and energy is supplied to the electronic devices that need energy in the bag. These devices are electric charger, heater and controller. In addition to these, The angle of the panels is designed to be manually adjustable to maximum benefit from sunlight. Solar panel provides 7W energy.7W is enough to fully charge the battery pack with a full day of sun (7-9 hours). A typical smartphone will have a 1440mAh 2200mAh battery. Thus, battery in the bag is 10000mAh The battery converts the stored solar energy into electrical energy and distributes them proportionally to the instantaneous energy requirement of the energy devices. As a result, the energy from the solar panel is used by the wireless charger, heater and most importantly the square code reader. </p>
